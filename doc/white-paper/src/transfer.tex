Transfering files should also preserve the anonimities of the two participating 
parties. The original idea for achieving this consisted of transfering the 
files along the same paths used for searching. This is not quite feasible as 
the search paths can have an arbitrary length and the resulted network 
congestion would be quite significant (similar to Tor).

The new idea involves the file provider randomly choosing a number of 
\textit{Randez-vous nodes} (or \textit{Drop Points}), where it will transfer 
chunks of the file. The addresses of these Drop Points are communicated to the 
file downloader by the means of the search reply message (figure 
\ref{fig:fig5}). The chunks of the file are encrypted using the Transfer Key 
sent using the search reply, due to the possibility of one of the Drop Points 
being controlled by an adversary. The number of Drop Points is chosen based on 
the size of the file and the configuration of the Drop Points. 100 MiB was 
chosen intuitively for the default maximum size of a chunk. The Drop Points are 
chosen from the pool of neighbors. If the file provider does not have enough 
neighbors, it may request more addresses from one of the DNL hosts. These new 
addresses will be used just for the current transfer and not added as neighbors.

At this point, the node which requested the file could just ask the Drop Points 
for the file chunks, but there is a Man-in-the-Middle attack possibility to 
consider. If an adversary replied to a search request and offers to transfer 
the file, it could provide node controlled by him as Drop Points. If the victim 
accesses those Drop Points directly then its identity would be known to the 
attacker. Being prudent, the downloader does not access the Drop Points 
directly, but instead delegates the "lifting" of the file chunks to a number of 
randomly chosen nodes, called \textit{Lift Proxies}. The process of choosing 
Lift Proxies is almost identical to the process of choosind Drop Points. A Lift 
Proxy node can be configured to lift chunk of a maximum size. Figure 
\ref{fig:fig7} illustrates a file transfer process.
