In the age of hypercapitalism, wealth inequality has become a growing and 
obvious issue. The rise of the internet gave people the means of constructing a 
new reality in which they can be free of social division and the constructs 
fabricated by the establishment while freely expressing themselves. In this new 
reality each individual is equal and has access to the same limitless 
resources. This did not last long however, as more businesses saw the 
opportunity of extracting wealth from this new reality. This had advantage of 
significantly increasing the amount of content and services available. However, 
the provided software and media is hidden behind pay walls and region locking 
mechanisms. The application of the free market - with all its disadvantages 
(like being prone to abuse) - in the world of the internet is even less 
justified because we cannot speak about the concept of scarcity in this 
context, one being able to replicate information indefinitely. Sharing 
copyrighted content became the norm for a while, in this way bridging the gap 
between the low and high income earners \cite{piracyinequality}, but more 
aggressive policies crept in the world of the internet, trying to regulate and 
punish the free flow of digital information.

Internet \textit{pirates}\footnote{Person who downloads and distributes 
copyrighted content digitally without permission, such as music or software 
\cite{CHOI2007168}} found ways to circumvent sanctions from the authority by 
using different means, each with its own disadvantages. Private torrent 
trackers are not accessible to any legitimate pirate, while VPN services are 
not free and one should be skeptical about the providers of these services. The 
Tor anonymity protocol is also great, but has the downside of having high 
latency and being prone to network congestion \cite{torcongestion}. Also, 
piracy is considered unethical over the Tor network because it might slow down 
more important communication between individuals living in autocratic regimes 
with high degree of censorship, which rely on anonymous communication on a 
daily basis.

The SAND protocol leverages the power of a worldwide P2P network, in which each 
node can act as proxy for another node to provide anonymity in communication. 
The main advantage over the BitTorrent protocol is that the identities of the 
two parties (uploader and downloader) are not known to each other. The chosen 
solution tries to find the optimal balance between network overhead and 
security. Each node is, of course, a volunteer in the network, as a part of the 
bandwidth will have to be donated for the benefit of the collective while the 
client application is running.
