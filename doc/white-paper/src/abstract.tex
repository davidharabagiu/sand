A protocol which focuses on protecting the anonymity of parties which 
distribute or download files, while being feasible for large file transfers, 
would simultaneously solve the main problems of centralized systems - 
BitTorrent and Tor. The idea is for the two parties (the downloader and 
uploader) to not have any way of discovering each other's identity, in case one 
of them is an adversary - the state authority for example. This is achieved 
through a peer-to-peer network of volunteers which can, at any time, assume the 
role of proxies carrying control messages and file transfers on other nodes' 
behalf. A vital component of the protocol is the file searching algorithm: by 
propagating a search request recursively through the network between nodes in 
random parts of the world will conceal the identity of the search initiator and 
make the complete network path unknowable to any individual party. File 
transfers are performed through a two-layer proxy, which conceals the 
identities of both uploader and downloader. The network participants are 
volunteers which sometimes passively donate bandwidth for the benefit of the 
community.
